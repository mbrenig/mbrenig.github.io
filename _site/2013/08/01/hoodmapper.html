<p>I live in San Francisco, and I hate searching for parking spaces.</p>

<p>So in 2011, when I was buying a car, I knew I&#8217;d need to find a permanent garage to keep it. Most garage spaces in this city are listed on <a href='http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/prk/'>craigslist</a>. Back in 2011, there was no map to search the city. So I did what any self-respecting geek would do and wrote a scraper to automatically read the posts, plot them on a map, and let me know when something near my house became available. This worked really well, and after two months I found a great spot 20 yards from my front door!</p>

<p>Now several months of crawling craigslist posts generates a lot of data, about 24,000 posts to be precise. Each post has a price, a description and an address but it also has a neighborhood, selected by the poster from a drop down list when they submit the ad. I used this information to show where craigslist users think the San Francisco neighborhoods are, and came up with this:</p>

<p><a href='http://hoodmapper.appspot.com'>hoodmapper.appspot.com</a></p>

<p>Explore a bit and you&#8217;ll notice some quirks:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is no Tenderloin. Famous for being dirty and crime-ridden area, no one wants to put that on their ad.</li>

<li>People are really confused about NOPA.. Is it Alamo Square? Lower Haight? Haigh-Ashbury? Pan Handle? or Western Addition?</li>

<li>Tweet me @mbrenig if you spot something else.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
